2) create v1 versions of DockerImageReference helpers
  - stop using internal DockerImageReference type (it exists in api)
  - would have to recreate a bunch of helpers from internal api as first class
    functions, not really worth it.


3) What to do about use of internal DockerImage type
  - origin-common/util/util.go:ImageWithMetadata()
  - is it being unmarshalled properly?
  - can we use the v1 DockerImage type instead? (should we?)
    - need to add DeepCopyObject to it

4) Resolve use of ImageWithMetadata internal version in test code
  - need to populate Image struct w/ layers for tests.
  - search for ImageWithMetadata
