1) move consts back into imageapi copy
2) create v1 versions of DockerImageReference helpers
  - stop using internal DockerImageReference type
3) What to do about use of internal DockerImage type
  - origin-common/util/util.go:ImageWithMetadata()
  - is it being unmarshalled properly?
  - can we use the v1 DockerImage type instead? (should we?)
    - need to add DeepCopyObject to it
